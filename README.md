**1. Project Aim:**  
To build an interactive and intuitive trading BOT that optimises techical indicators through machine learning to provide highly accurate investment and trading      recommendations. Predicting how price interacts with technical indicator (EMA) Testing models to maximise indicator performance

  What is the feature set? Prediction set? 
Feature set: date, high, low, open, close
Prediction set: indicator crossing EMA 30
  
**2. Key Technologies:** 
  
To use machine learning through the Ensemble Method to filter accurate buy/sell recommendations from three key technical indicationrs.


   [MACD](https://investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp)  
   Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD, or MAC-D) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages      (EMAs) of a security’s price. The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA.
   
   [Bollinger Bands](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bollingerbands.asp)  
  A Bollinger Band® is a technical analysis tool defined by a set of trendlines plotted two standard deviations (positively and negatively) away from a simple moving average (SMA) of a security's price, but which can be adjusted to user preferences.
  
  [Exponential Moving Averages](https://investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp)  
   An exponential moving average (EMA) is a type of moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points. The exponential moving average is also referred to as the exponentially weighted moving average. An exponentially weighted moving average reacts more significantly to recent price changes than a simple moving average simple moving average (SMA), which applies an equal weight to all observations in the period.
  
  [Relative Strenght Index](https://investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp)  
  The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to evaluate overvalued or undervalued conditions in the price of that security.
  
  [Ensemble Methods](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html)  
  The goal of ensemble methods is to combine the predictions of several base estimators built with a given learning algorithm in order to improve generalizability/  robustness over a single estimator.
  
  
  
  
  

  Technical Analysis MACD, Bollinger Bands & Stochastics.  
    b. Ensemble method classifier.  
    c. Optimise weightings between 3 indices (if time permits).  
    d. Lexbot.  

  
  
  
a.	To utilise machine learning to outcompete the profitability and risk of the S&P 500 (Sharpe Ratio).  
b.	Determine best trading strategy using Machine Learning and trading technical indicator for S&P 500.
c.	We are trying to train a model to predict which indicators best predict index prices?


2.	What is the machine learning component predicting?
a.	Predicting how price interacts with technical indicator (EMA)
b.	Testing models to maximise indicator performance
c.	What is the feature set? Prediction set? 
i.	Feature set: date, high, low, open, close
ii.	Prediction set: indicator crossing EMA 30
