**1. Project Aim**
  
To build an interactive and intuitive trading BOT that optimises techical indicators through machine learning to provide highly accurate investment and trading      recommendations. 
  
**2. Key Technologies**  
  
   [MACD](https://investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp)  
   Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD, or MAC-D) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages      (EMAs) of a securityâ€™s price. The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA.
  
  [Ensemble Methods](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html)  
  The goal of ensemble methods is to combine the predictions of several base estimators built with a given learning algorithm in order to improve generalizability/  robustness over a single estimator...
  

  Technical Analysis MACD, Bollinger Bands & Stochastics.  
    b. Ensemble method classifier.  
    c. Optimise weightings between 3 indices (if time permits).  
    d. Lexbot.  

  
  
  
a.	To utilise machine learning to outcompete the profitability and risk of the S&P 500 (Sharpe Ratio).  
b.	Determine best trading strategy using Machine Learning and trading technical indicator for S&P 500.
c.	We are trying to train a model to predict which indicators best predict index prices?


2.	What is the machine learning component predicting?
a.	Predicting how price interacts with technical indicator (EMA)
b.	Testing models to maximise indicator performance
c.	What is the feature set? Prediction set? 
i.	Feature set: date, high, low, open, close
ii.	Prediction set: indicator crossing EMA 30
